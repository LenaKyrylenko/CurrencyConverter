# CURRENCY CONVERTER

**Exchange rate component**
- Display of the current exchange rate (USD, EUR) against the hryvnia (UAH)
- The current exchange rate comes from the public API

**Conversion occurs in both directions**
- When changing the value in the first currency, the value in the second one is recalculated, and vice versa
- When changing the currency in each select, the conversion of both currencies should be recalculated correctly
